Repo for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

run_analysis.R reads in the data and all other files from the working directory in which I unzipped the UCI HAR data.
The directory path will need to be changed but otherwise the script does not require additional input from the user. The output is tidydat.txt, a data set further described in Code Book.md
